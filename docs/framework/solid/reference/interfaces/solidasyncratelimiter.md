### state

```ts

```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts:20](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts#L20)

Reactive state that will be updated when the rate limiter state changes

Use this instead of `rateLimiter.store.state`

***

### ~~store~~

```ts
readonly store: Store<Readonly<AsyncRateLimiterState<TFn>>>;
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts:26](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts#L26)

#### Deprecated

Use `rateLimiter.state` instead of `rateLimiter.store.state` if you want to read reactive state.
The state on the store object is not reactive, as it has not been wrapped in a `useStore` hook internally.
Although, you can make the state reactive by using the `useStore` in your own usage.
