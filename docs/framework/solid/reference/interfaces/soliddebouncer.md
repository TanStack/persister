Reactive state that will be updated when the debouncer state changes

Use this instead of `debouncer.store.state`

***

### ~~store~~

```ts
readonly store: Store<Readonly<DebouncerState<TFn>>>;
```

Defined in: [debouncer/createDebouncer.ts:25](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/debouncer/createDebouncer.ts#L25)

#### Deprecated

Use `debouncer.state` instead of `debouncer.store.state` if you want to read reactive state.
The state on the store object is not reactive, as it has not been wrapped in a `useStore` hook internally.
Although, you can make the state reactive by using the `useStore` in your own usage.
