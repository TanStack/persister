# Function: createThrottler()

```ts
function createThrottler<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   initialOptions, 
selector): SolidThrottler<TFn, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [throttler/createThrottler.ts:99](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/throttler/createThrottler.ts#L99)

A low-level Solid hook that creates a `Throttler` instance that limits how often the provided function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc). For a simpler and higher-level hook that
integrates directly with Solid's createSignal, see createThrottledSignal.

Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting
expensive operations or UI updates.

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available state properties:
- `canLeadingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the leading edge
- `canTrailingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the trailing edge
- `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
- `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
- `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
- `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last execution
- `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the next allowed execution
- `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending')

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

• **TSelected** = \{\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`ThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

[`SolidThrottler`](../../../../../../interfaces/solidthrottler.md)\<`TFn`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const throttler = createThrottler(setValue, { wait: 1000 });

// Opt-in to re-render when isPending changes (optimized for loading states)
const throttler = createThrottler(
  setValue,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when executionCount changes (optimized for tracking execution)
const throttler = createThrottler(
  setValue,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
);

// Multiple state properties - re-render when any of these change
const throttler = createThrottler(
  setValue,
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  },
  (state) => ({
    isPending: state.isPending,
    executionCount: state.executionCount,
    lastExecutionTime: state.lastExecutionTime,
    nextExecutionTime: state.nextExecutionTime
  })
);

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { isPending, executionCount } = throttler.state();
```
