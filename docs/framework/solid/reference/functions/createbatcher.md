# Function: createBatcher()

```ts
function createBatcher<TValue, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   initialOptions, 
selector): SolidBatcher<TValue, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [batcher/createBatcher.ts:100](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/batcher/createBatcher.ts#L100)

Creates a Solid-compatible Batcher instance for managing batches of items, exposing Solid signals for all stateful properties.

Features:
- Batch processing of items using the provided `fn` function
- Configurable batch size and wait time
- Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute
- Event callbacks for monitoring batch operations
- All stateful properties (items, counts, etc.) are exposed as Solid signals for reactivity

The batcher collects items and processes them in batches based on:
- Maximum batch size
- Time-based batching (process after X milliseconds)
- Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available state properties:
- `executionCount`: Number of batch executions that have been completed
- `isRunning`: Whether the batcher is currently running (not stopped)
- `items`: Array of items currently queued for batching
- `totalItemsProcessed`: Total number of individual items that have been processed across all batches

Example usage:
```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const batcher = createBatcher(
  (items) => {
    // Process batch of items
    console.log('Processing batch:', items);
  },
  {
    maxSize: 5,
    wait: 2000,
    onExecute: (batcher) => console.log('Batch executed'),
    getShouldExecute: (items) => items.length >= 3
  }
);

// Opt-in to re-render when items or isRunning changes (optimized for UI updates)
const batcher = createBatcher(
  (items) => console.log('Processing batch:', items),
  { maxSize: 5, wait: 2000 },
  (state) => ({ items: state.items, isRunning: state.isRunning })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for tracking progress)
const batcher = createBatcher(
  (items) => console.log('Processing batch:', items),
  { maxSize: 5, wait: 2000 },
  (state) => ({
    executionCount: state.executionCount,
    totalItemsProcessed: state.totalItemsProcessed
  })
);

// Add items to batch
batcher.addItem('task1');
batcher.addItem('task2');

// Control the batcher
batcher.stop();  // Pause processing
batcher.start(); // Resume processing

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { items, isRunning } = batcher.state();
```
