# Function: createRateLimiter()

```ts
function createRateLimiter<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   initialOptions, 
selector): SolidRateLimiter<TFn, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [rate-limiter/createRateLimiter.ts:102](https://github.com/TanStack/persister/blob/main/packages/solid-persister/src/rate-limiter/createRateLimiter.ts#L102)

A low-level Solid hook that creates a `RateLimiter` instance to enforce rate limits on function execution.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach that allows executions until a maximum count is reached within
a time window, then blocks all subsequent calls until the window resets. Unlike throttling or debouncing,
it does not attempt to space out or collapse executions intelligently.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

For smoother execution patterns:
- Use throttling when you want consistent spacing between executions (e.g. UI updates)
- Use debouncing when you want to collapse rapid-fire events (e.g. search input)
- Use rate limiting only when you need to enforce hard limits (e.g. API rate limits)

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available state properties:
- `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
- `rejectionCount`: Number of function calls that were rejected due to rate limiting
- `remainingInWindow`: Number of executions remaining in the current window
- `nextWindowTime`: Timestamp when the next window begins
- `currentWindowStart`: Timestamp when the current window started

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

• **TSelected** = \{\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### initialOptions

`RateLimiterOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

[`SolidRateLimiter`](../../../../../../../../interfaces/solidratelimiter.md)\<`TFn`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const rateLimiter = createRateLimiter(apiCall, {
  limit: 5,
  window: 60000,
  windowType: 'sliding',
  onReject: (rateLimiter) => {
    console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${rateLimiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
  }
});

// Opt-in to re-render when rate limit state changes (optimized for UI feedback)
const rateLimiter = createRateLimiter(
  apiCall,
  { limit: 5, window: 60000 },
  (state) => ({
    remainingInWindow: state.remainingInWindow,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for tracking progress)
const rateLimiter = createRateLimiter(
  apiCall,
  { limit: 5, window: 60000 },
  (state) => ({
    executionCount: state.executionCount,
    nextWindowTime: state.nextWindowTime
  })
);

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { remainingInWindow, rejectionCount } = rateLimiter.state();
```
